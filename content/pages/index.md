      Some like the Garden Tiger moth have seen their numbers drop by 90%. Loss
      of habitat, use of pesticides and climate change are all responsible for
      these dramatic changes in moth populations.


      Thank you for taking an interest in the Missing Moths project. This site
      will guide you to resources that show what you can do to help reverse the
      fate of moths and other insects.


      If you've seen a Missing Moths poster in the wild, please take a picture
      and spread the word on Instagram and Twitter by tagging it with
      **#MissingMoths**. We'd also love to see your moths there too!

          There are a few simple steps you can take to make your garden into a
          haven for wildlife.


          *   Plant nectar rich plants to feed pollinating insects 


          *   Leave wild patches of 'weeds' where butterflies and moths can
          breed


          *   Don't use pesticides, encourage natural predators to control
          problem pests instead.


          *   Switch to peat-free compost to protect vital habitat for rare
          moths


          The charity Butterfly Conservation have a comprehensive guide to
          gardening for moths (and butterflies!) on their website with details
          on all of these steps. They  also have a month-by-month blog to keep
          you on track with upcoming garden tasks. Find out more on the

        subtitle: Contribute to science from your garden

          Lots of people keep a record of the moths they see. These records are
          used for a range of conservation purposes, such as conserving
          habitats, understanding the impact of climate change on different
          species and improving understanding of moth ecology.


          You can get involved with very little commitment. You could record day
          flying moths that you see on a walk or go out looking with a torch at
          dusk. Once you're bitten by the mothing bug, you may want to invest in
          a moth trap and discover the delights that fly around the night sky.


          It can be overwhelming when you first start identifying moths (there
          are over 2000 species in the UK) but there are helpful groups on
          [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1657981907786185) and
          [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MothIDUK) who are happy to help with any
          polite requests. Find out more about moth recording and how to submit
          records on the Butterfly Conservation website:

          I'm Anna,  I love moths, butterflies and other insects. I worked for
          ten years in ecommerce marketing but now I'm using my powers for good.


          I want to introduce others to the joys found in natural world so they
          will protect what we have and create new spaces for nature. I believe
          that art and creativity can be used to communicate scientific ideas
          and engage people who might think science isn't for them.


          I'm in the final year of an Open University degree in Natural Sciences
          (Environmental Science).
