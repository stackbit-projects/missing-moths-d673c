      Some like the Garden Tiger moth have seen their numbers drop by 90%. Loss
      of habitat, use of pesticides and climate change are all responsible for
      these dramatic changes in moth populations.


      Thank you for taking an interest in the Missing Moths project. This site
      will guide you to resources that show what you can do to help reverse the
      fate of moths and other insects.


      If you've seen a Missing Moths poster in the wild, please take a picture

          There are a few simple steps you can take to make your garden into a
          haven for wildlife.


          *   Plant nectar rich plants to feed pollinating insects 


          *   Leave wild patches of 'weeds' where butterflies and moths can
          breed


          *   Don't use pesticides, encourage natural predators to control
          problem pests instead.


          *   Switch to peat-free compost to protect vital habitat for rare
          moths

          I'm Anna,  I love moths, butterflies and other insects. I worked for
          ten years in ecommerce marketing but now I'm using my powers for good.


          I want to introduce others to the joys found in natural world so they
          will protect what we have and create new spaces for nature. I believe
          that art and creativity can be used to communicate scientific ideas
          and engage people who might think science isn't for them.


          I'm in the final year of an Open University degree in Natural Sciences
          (Environmental Science).
